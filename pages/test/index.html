<p   class = "pstyle" style="text-align: justify;">Hello and welcome to my website.</p>
<p   class = "pstyle" style="text-align: justify;">I plan to use this site as a personal dump of sorts, so not everything here will be of good quality. In fact, most things here probably won't be
 useful to many people but still, feel free to do anything you want with whatever you find. Also feel free to check out my blog!</p>
<p   class = "pstyle" style="text-align: justify;">Also, nothing on this website works well on mobile. Works great on terminal browsers like w3m though!</p>
<p   class = "pstyle">Below, you can find a list of my blog posts sorted by date. <a href="../../rss.xml">Here</a> is a link to the rss feed you can subscribe to through an rss reader.</p>
<p   class = "pstyle">What is this blog about? Well anything really. I don't really expect anyone to read it, so it's mostly me talking to the wind. I might post about whatever I'm thinking about, or a project I'm working on etc. </p>
