<p>My job routinely requires me to name certain things (ie. ships for simulation) and thus I made a list of 100 names in 10 categories to pull from. The list includes the names or surnames of real and fictional people (and a dog, and two objects). I have uploaded the file to the website, you can find it under the 'files' page, feel free to use it for whatever purpose. </p>
<p>I may grow the list further in the future, in which case the file will be updated. If it's a particularly big update, I might make another blog post about it as well.</p>

<p>Alright, here goes my first ever blog post.</p>
<p>For now, I am editing everything manually, including the rss xml. That's a huge pain so I am looking into solutions. I like the simplicity of this but on the other hand, it's really inconvenient.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will cut it short for the first post, this is about all I wanted to say.</p>
